# Mobile-Development

In our mobile development project, we began by designing a user-friendly interface in Figma. This design was then meticulously sliced and translated into Android Studio using XML layout files to ensure the UI components matched the design precisely. For the authentication feature, we utilized APIs and verified their interactions with Postman, ensuring secure and reliable user login and registration processes. We also developed a custom library that includes a dictionary feature, which fetches data from an API to provide users with a comprehensive and up-to-date resource. In addition, we implemented Adapter and ViewModel using Kotlin, which facilitated efficient data management and UI updates. We also integrated an API to collect and manage data from users, enhancing personalization and functionality. One of the key features of our app is a game that integrates an API for prediction functionality. This feature allows users to take photos with the camera or upload images from the gallery, which are then sent to the API for real-time predictions. The entire development process, conducted in Kotlin, ensured robust performance and seamless integration of all features.
