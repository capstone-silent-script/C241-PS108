## üì±Application Background
<p align="justify">Communication is essential for human connection and understanding. However, not everyone can communicate easily, especially those with hearing impairments or deafness. In March 2022, there were 19,324 people in Indonesia with hearing difficulties, highlighting the need for accessible communication tools and inclusive education. SilentScript addresses this need by offering an innovative, interactive, and user-friendly platform to learn Indonesian Sign Language (BISINDO). Our app supports the Indonesian government's efforts to aid individuals with disabilities, as stated in Undang-Undang No. 8 Tahun 2016. This law ensures the rights of people with disabilities, including their right to education and communication. SilentScript helps implement these policies by providing a comprehensive sign language learning tool, promoting equal opportunities and accessibility for everyone. </p>
