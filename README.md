# Mobile-Development

Designed a user-friendly interface in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/bMKJ0hyDhmpnDxbfPDpLdb/Capstone-Figma?node-id=0-1&t=5YoDqOwnaRCLIUh7-0). This design was then meticulously cut and translated into Android Studio using XML layout files to ensure the UI components fit the design precisely. For authentication features, we used the API and verified its interaction with Postman, ensuring a secure and reliable user login and registration process. We also developed a custom library that includes a dictionary feature, which retrieves data from the API to provide users with a comprehensive and up-to-date resource. In addition, we implemented the Adapter and ViewModel using Kotlin, which facilitates efficient data management and UI updates. We also integrated APIs to collect and manage data from users, enhancing personalization and functionality. One of the key features of our app is a game that integrates APIs for prediction functions. This feature allows users to take photos with the camera or upload images from the gallery, which are then sent to the API for real-time prediction. The entire development process, done in Kotlin, ensures robust performance and seamless integration of all features.
