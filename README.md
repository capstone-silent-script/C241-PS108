# Machine-Learning
In this project we made a model to detect image and classified it to an alphabet from A-Z. This model is trained from BISINDO dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungmrf/indonesian-sign-language-bisindo). This model is trained using Transfer Learning called ResNet50 and trained with 30 epoch with an accuracy of 0.9924 and validation accuracy of 0.9881.

This branch consists of:
- [Machine-Learning-BISINDO-Model.ipynb](Machine-Learning-BISINDO-Model.ipynb): Where we made our model and train our model, using Python 3.10.12. 
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): Requirements needed to run .ipynb file.
- [model.zip](model.zip): Machine Learning Model converted to TFJS that consist of .bin files and .json.
